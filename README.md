# expense-tracker-GUI
hi all, i have built a expense tracker using GUI tkinter. it was fun and exhilarating to do this project
- Added windows for adding new expenses, viewing all expenses, searching by date, and deleting entries
- Data is saved and loaded from a JSON file so nothing gets lost between sessions
- Used Treeview tables with scrollbars for neat and scrollable expense lists
- Included input checks and friendly pop-ups to guide users and prevent mistakes
- Improved the layout to make the app easier and nicer to use

Excited to keep improving this and make managing expenses effortless and even a bit fun!
