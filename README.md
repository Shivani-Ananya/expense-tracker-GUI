# expense-tracker-GUI
hi all, i have built a expense tracker using GUI tkinter. it was fun and exhilarating to do this project

Added windows for adding new expenses, viewing all expenses, searching by date, and deleting entries
Data is saved and loaded from a JSON file so nothing gets lost between sessions
Used Treeview tables with scrollbars for neat and scrollable expense lists
Included input checks and friendly pop-ups to guide users and prevent mistakes
Improved the layout to make the app easier and nicer to use
Excited to keep improving this and make managing expenses effortless and even a bit fun!
